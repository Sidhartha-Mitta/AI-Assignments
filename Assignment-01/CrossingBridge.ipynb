    "Amogh, Ameya and their grandparents have to cross a bridge over the river within one hour to catch a train. It is raining and they have only one umbrella which can be shared by two people. Assuming that no one wants to get wet, how can they get across in an hour or less? Amogh can cross the bridge in 5 minutes, Ameya in 10, their grandmother in 20, and their grandfather in 25. Design a search algorithm to answer the question."
