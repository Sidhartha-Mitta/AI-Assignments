### Comparison: Best-First Search vs A*

Best-First Search and A* are informed search algorithms used for pathfinding.  
Best-First Search relies only on the heuristic function `h(n)`.  
It greedily selects the node that seems closest to the goal.  
This makes it faster in some cases but not always reliable.  
It may fail to find the shortest or optimal path.  

A* improves this by using `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`.  
Here, `g(n)` is the cost so far and `h(n)` is the estimated cost to goal.  
This balance ensures both completeness and optimality (if `h(n)` is admissible).  
A* often requires more memory and computation than Best-First Search.  
In short, Best-First Search prioritizes speed, while A* ensures accuracy and optimal paths.
